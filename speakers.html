  <p> <h3>Retrospectives Panel</h3> </p>
  <p> In addition to the speakers above, we will have a restrospectives panel amongst the <a href="https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/speakers.html">panelists</a> from the first offline RL workshop to discuss how their viewpoints and beliefs have changed about different aspects of offline RL in terms of challenges, important open problems, etc. Panelists include Sergey Levine, Emma Brunskill, Nando De Freitas, Finale Doshi-Velez. This panel would be moderated by Nan Jiang. </p>
